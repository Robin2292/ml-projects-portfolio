## Projects

### 1. Automated Fact-Checking System
- Developed a **multi-stage NLP pipeline** to classify climate-related claims into {SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT_ENOUGH_INFO, DISPUTED}.
- Four-stage architecture: preprocessing → evidence shortlisting → BERT-based retrieval → classification.
- **Result:** 0.602 accuracy & 0.620 F-score (baseline TF-IDF + Transformer: 0.537 accuracy, 0.067 F-score).

### 2. Text Generation Detection (Kaggle Competition)
- Built classifiers to detect **human vs machine-generated text** across multiple domains.  
- Tackled **domain adaptation** and **imbalanced classification** challenges.  
- Designed an **ensemble of CNN, TF-IDF MLP, and BiLSTM**, with detailed error analysis and ablation studies.  
- **Result:** 92.63% accuracy, achieved **Top-10 Kaggle leaderboard** performance.

### 3. Game AI for Azul
- Designed a strategic agent leveraging **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and **Minimax search** for optimal move planning.  
- Evaluated against peers and ranked **Top 5 in the cohort**.

### 4. Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
- Designed and trained RL agents (**PPO and SAC**) for a **full-scale autonomous driving simulator**.  
- Developed a reward function balancing lane-keeping, speed regulation, smooth steering, and comfort.  
- Applied **domain randomization** (road curvature, surfaces, dynamics) to improve generalization.  
- **Result:** Achieved safe and transferable driving performance; PPO excelled in stability, SAC in safety during sharp turns.
